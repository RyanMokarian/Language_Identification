Ttile: Probabilistic Unigram and Bigram models to identify language

Category: Machine Learning

Author: Ryan Mokarian

Description:
/*
    This project builds and experiments with a probabilistic language identification system to identify
    language of a sentence. First, unigram and bigram character-based language models for English, French
    and German languages are trained. Then, the trained language models are used for the identification of
    the most probable language of 30 sentences given in an input file called "30Sentences.txt".
    For the training set, the following three files (trainFR.txt, trainEN.txt and trainGE.txt) and used.
    All four files should be located inside a folder called "files".
    Note: modify the FILEPATH address in the Main class to an address where you want to locate the project.
    Current default project path is "C:\\Users\\NGram_Language_Identification".
